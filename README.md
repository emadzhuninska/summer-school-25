# QUTE Summer School 2025
# Quantum Programming Workshop

This repository contains materials from the **Quantum Programming with Qiskit** workshop as part of the [Quantum Technologies Summer School 2025](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/qute2025/) held at FH Technikum Wien.

## üìö Workshop Overview

Quantum programming refers to the process of designing and implementing algorithms that operate on quantum systems, typically using quantum circuits composed of quantum gates, measurements, and classical control logic. These circuits are developed to manipulate quantum states for specific computational tasks or experimental outcomes.

In this workshop, participants explored how qubits and gates are implemented using the open-source Python-based software Qiskit. The scripts were run on quantum simulators and visualized on a Bloch sphere.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants learned:

- Basic methods and functions of Qiskit
- How to run quantum circuits on quantum simulators
- Visualization of qubits on a Bloch sphere
- Fundamental concepts of quantum circuit design
- Practical implementation of quantum algorithms

## üîß Prerequisites

This workshop was designed for participants already familiar with Python or another programming language. Basic programming concepts (variables, data types, control flow, Python syntax) were not covered in the workshop.

### Required Knowledge:
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts
- No prior quantum physics knowledge required

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To run the materials in this repository, you'll need to install Qiskit and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install qiskit
pip install qiskit-aer
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```
